I"0<p>One of the first questions you’ll ask yourself when starting to train a neural network is <strong>“what do I set the learning rate to?”</strong> Often the answer to this is one of those things in deep learning people lump into the “alchemy” category… Just because there really isn’t a one size-fits-all answer. Instead, it takes tinkering on the part of the researcher to find the most appropriate number for that given problem. This post tries to provide a little more intuition around picking appropriate values for your learning rates.</p>
